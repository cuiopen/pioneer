A networking framework for clusters.

Features:
1. connection pool
2. tcp client pool
3. ready to run network servers
4. easy to use rpc framework

It's extremely easy to use the framework to write your own servers working together in a cluster:
all you need to do is to write functions, register them to the framework, and then call them 
just like normal, native functions.
