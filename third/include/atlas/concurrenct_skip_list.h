This implements a sorted associative container that supports only
unique keys.  (Similar to std::set.)

Features:

  1. Small memory overhead: ~40% less memory overhead compared with
     std::set (1.6 words per node versus 3). It has an minimum of 4
     words (7 words if there nodes got deleted) per-list overhead
     though.

  2. Read accesses (count, find iterator, skipper) are lock-free and
     mostly wait-free (the only wait a reader may need to do is when
     the node it is visiting is in a pending stage, i.e. deleting,
     adding and not fully linked).  Write accesses (remove, add) need
     to acquire locks, but locks are local to the predecessor nodes
     and/or successor nodes.

  3. Good high contention performance, comparable single-thread
     performance.  In the multithreaded case (12 workers), CSL tested
     10x faster than a RWSpinLocked std::set for an averaged sized
     list (1K - 1M nodes).

     Comparable read performance to std::set when single threaded,
     especially when the list size is large, and scales better to
     larger lists: when the size is small, CSL can be 20-50% slower on
     find()/contains().  As the size gets large (> 1M elements),
     find()/contains() can be 30% faster.

     Iterating through a skiplist is similar to iterating through a
     linked list, thus is much (2-6x) faster than on a std::set
     (tree-based).  This is especially true for short lists due to
     better cache locality.  Based on that, it's also faster to
     intersect two skiplists.

  4. Lazy removal with GC support.  The removed nodes get deleted when
     the last Accessor to the skiplist is destroyed.

Caveats:

  1. Write operations are usually 30% slower than std::set in a single
     threaded environment.

  2. Need to have a head node for each list, which has a 4 word
     overhead.

  3. When the list is quite small (< 1000 elements), single threaded
     benchmarks show CSL can be 10x slower than std:set.

  4. The interface requires using an Accessor to access the skiplist.
    (See below.)

  5. Currently x64 only, due to use of MicroSpinLock.

  6. Freed nodes will not be reclaimed as long as there are ongoing
     uses of the list.

Sample usage:

     typedef ConcurrentSkipList<int> SkipListT;
     shared_ptr<SkipListT> sl(SkipListT::createInstance(init_head_height);
     {
       // It's usually good practice to hold an accessor only during
       // its necessary life cycle (but not in a tight loop as
       // Accessor creation incurs ref-counting overhead).
       //
       // Holding it longer delays garbage-collecting the deleted
       // nodes in the list.
       SkipListT::Accessor accessor(sl);
       accessor.insert(23);
       accessor.erase(2);
       for (auto &elem : accessor) {
         // use elem to access data
       }
       ... ...
     }

 Another useful type is the Skipper accessor.  This is useful if you
 want to skip to locations in the way std::lower_bound() works,
 i.e. it can be used for going through the list by skipping to the
 node no less than a specified key.  The Skipper keeps its location as
 state, which makes it convenient for things like implementing
 intersection of two sets efficiently, as it can start from the last
 visited position.

     {
       SkipListT::Accessor accessor(sl);
       SkipListT::Skipper skipper(accessor);
       skipper.to(30);
       if (skipper) {
         CHECK_LE(30, *skipper);
       }
       ...  ...
       // GC may happen when the accessor gets destructed.
     }
