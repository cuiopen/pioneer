// A btree implementation of the STL set and map interfaces. A btree is both
// smaller and faster than STL set/map. The red-black tree implementation of
// STL set/map has an overhead of 3 pointers (left, right and parent) plus the
// node color information for each stored value. So a set<int32> consumes 20
// bytes for each value stored. This btree implementation stores multiple
// values on fixed size nodes (usually 256 bytes) and doesn't store child
// pointers for leaf nodes. The result is that a btree_set<int32> may use much
// less memory per stored value. For the random insertion benchmark in
// btree_test.cc, a btree_set<int32> with node-size of 256 uses 4.9 bytes per
// stored value.
//
// The packing of multiple values on to each node of a btree has another effect
// besides better space utilization: better cache locality due to fewer cache
// lines being accessed. Better cache locality translates into faster
// operations.
//
// CAVEATS
//
// Insertions and deletions on a btree can cause splitting, merging or
// rebalancing of btree nodes. And even without these operations, insertions
// and deletions on a btree will move values around within a node. In both
// cases, the result is that insertions and deletions can invalidate iterators
// pointing to values other than the one being inserted/deleted. This is
// notably different from STL set/map which takes care to not invalidate
// iterators on insert/erase except, of course, for iterators pointing to the
// value being erased.  A partial workaround when erasing is available:
// erase() returns an iterator pointing to the item just after the one that was
// erased (or end() if none exists).  See also safe_btree.
